# Context :

At leboncoin, our users can share messages about a transaction, or ask for informations about any products.

Your job is to create the interface to consult those messages.
The interface needs to work on both desktop & mobile devices.

In addition to your code, a README explaining your thought process and your choices would be appreciated.

# Exercice :

- Display a list of all the conversations
- Allow the user to select a conversation
  - Inside the conversation, there is a list of all the messages between these two users.
  - As a user, you can type and send new messages in this conversation

**As your application can be used by millions of users, make sure to provide some robust safety guards.**

### Sketches :

Obvisouly, it is up to you to make something nice and pretty, you are free to design it the way you like. The sketches are here to give you an idea on how it should look.

### API :

You can find the API swagger file in `docs/api-swagger.yaml`.

For a better readibility, you can view it on [https://leboncoin.tech/frontend-technical-test/](https://leboncoin.tech/frontend-technical-test/).

## Bonus 1 :

We provide some conversation samples, but can you improve the app so the user can now create new conversations ?

## Bonus 2 :

Our infrastructure is a bit shaky.. Sometimes the servers are crashing. “It’s not you, it’s me”, but maybe you can display something nice to warn the user and handle it gracefully.

## Do you want to make the app even better ?

Feel free to make as many improvements as you like.
We love creativity and technical challenges.

If you are out of ideas, here are some thoughts :

- As we want to reach our users anywhere, we need to make sure the app is performing well. What can you do to make it really fast ?

- Our goal is to support everybody in the country, including people with disabilities. As a good citizen and a good developer, can you make sure the app is accessible for everyone ?

- We all love to relax after a hard day’s work. It would be a shame if we didn’t feel confident enough about the upcoming automatic deployment. Are you sure everything has been tested thoroughly ?

#Realization
## ESLINT
In order to facilitate the life of the developers, not to have changes on git only at the level of indentation or style of code and to follow the best recommendations during phase of development, it is necessary to see very important to use a linter.
### Check linter
Pour tester le linter il faut lancer la commande suivante
``` $ npm run lint```
### Fix lint bug automatically
To fix linter bugs automatically, run the following command
```$ npm run prettify```

## Conventional Commits
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages. 
The commit message should be structured as follows:

`<type>[optional scope]: <description>``
- ***fix***: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- ***feat***: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends **build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:**, and others.
